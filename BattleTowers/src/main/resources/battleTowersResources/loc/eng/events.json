After several minutes, it reaches down, grabs the deck, and accepts your trade.

Name's River,\" the hulking man says. \"Can I interest you in a unique, hand-crafted battle standard?\"",

There's nothing stopping you from grabbing one and running, and that thought is just too tempting. NL NL As you make haste with your new banner in hand, the fabric becomes excruciating to touch! Suddenly, the cloth changes from a vibrant warm color to a harsh deep purple, and where once was an embroidered image now lies a horribly inked skull. It appears the Giant had some protection on his wares after all.",
      "Although these tapestries are incredibly well-made, they aren't a smart use of your funds right now. You browse for awhile, but then continue up the Battle Tower."
