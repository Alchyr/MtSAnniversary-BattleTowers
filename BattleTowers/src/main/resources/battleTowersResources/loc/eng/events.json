      "The golem takes an age to process this offer, glancing down at the deck of cards sitting beside its black and white table. After several minutes, it reaches down, grabs the deck, and accepts your trade. NL NL Although the golem doesn't appear to be able to express much emotion, you can tell it remains disappointed you decided not to play its game."
